description: "Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) is a software application designed for molecular dynamics simulations. It has the potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductor), soft matter (biomolecules, polymers), and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. The main use-case is atom scale particle modeling or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meson, or continuum scale. LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. Read more on the LAMMPS website https://lammps.sandia.gov/."
