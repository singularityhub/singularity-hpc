description: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) is
  a software application designed for molecular dynamics simulations. It has the potentials
  for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductor), soft matter (biomolecules, polymers),
  and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. The main use-case is atom scale particle
  modeling or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meson,
  or continuum scale. LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing
  techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. Read more on the
  LAMMPS website https://lammps.sandia.gov/.
