description: PyTorch is a GPU accelerated tensor computational framework with a Python
  front end. Functionality can be easily extended with common Python libraries such
  as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython. Automatic differentiation is done with a tape-based
  system at both a functional and neural network layer level.
