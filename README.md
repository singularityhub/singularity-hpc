Singularity HPC is optimized for managing containers in an HPC environment. Currently, this includes
module technologies:

 - [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/)

And container technologies:

 - [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity)
 - [Podman](https://podman.io)
 - [Docker](https://docker.io)

Coming soon:

 - [Shifter](https://github.com/NERSC/shifter)

You can use shpc if you are:

1. a linux administrator wanting to manage containers as modules for your cluster
2. a cluster user that wants to maintain your own folder of custom modules
3. a cluster user that simply wants to pull Singularity images as GitHub packages.

These use cases will be better flushed out and documented as the library is developed.
