Singularity HPC is based off of the [Singularity Registry Client](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry-cli), but instead of
being intended for general interaction with Singularity containers and a local database, it's optimized for managing containers
in an HPC environment. Currently, this includes:

 - [LMOD](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You can use shpc if you are:

1. a linux administrator wanting to manage containers as modules for your cluster
2. a cluster user that wants to maintain your own folder of custom modules
3. a cluster user that simply wants to pull Singularity images as GitHub packages.

These use cases will be better flushed out and documented as the library is developed.

There are other tools that you might be interested in!

 - [VA Research Computing](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/software/containers/) has a similar system, but I couldn't find any code.
 - [Community Collections](https://github.com/community-collections/community-collections)
 - [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_file_support.html) installs modules for software built from source (not containers).
 
## TODOS
 
 - add other registry containers
 - the admin that runs shpc should have an easier way to see commands (other than lmod)
 - ensure that we print columns to shpc list
