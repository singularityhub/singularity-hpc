  abstract  = "Here we present Singularity, software developed to bring
               containers and reproducibility to scientific computing. Using
               Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible
               environments of their choosing and design, and these complete
               environments can easily be copied and executed on other
               platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that
               harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and
               researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common
               workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case,
               Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC
               centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute
               software and compute environments. This ability to create and
               deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a
               previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing
               development for computational science.",

               thousands of users. To support broad user communities and manage
               a user-friendly environment, end-user sites must combine a range
               of low-level system software with multiple compiler chains,
               support libraries, and a suite of 3rd party applications. In
               addition, large systems require bare metal provisioning and a
               flexible software management strategy to maintain consistency
               and upgrade-ability across thousands of compute nodes. This

                   aspects of scientific research, computational
                   reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance
                   to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike.
                   Though computational reproducibility seems more straight
                   forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex
                   and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes
                   being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious
                   challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code
                   developed for one research project cannot be successfully
                   executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review
                   current approaches to these issues, including virtual
                   machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then
                   examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines
                   several areas from systems research - such as operating
                   system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular
                   re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy,
                   to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several
                   examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical
                   environment.",

               should be executable and repeatable processes. Most of the
               current approaches for computational experiment conservation and
               reproducibility have focused so far on two of the main
               components of the experiment, namely, data and method. In this
               paper, we propose a new approach that addresses the third
               cornerstone of experimental reproducibility: the equipment. This
               work focuses on the equipment of a computational experiment,
               that is, the set of software and hardware components that are
               involved in the execution of a scientific workflow. In order to
               demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we describe a use
               case scenario on the Text Analytics domain and the application
               of our approach to it. From the original workflow, we document
               its execution environment, by means of a set of semantic models
               and a catalogue of resources, and generate an equivalent
               infrastructure for reexecuting it.",

                   SDM has been in active use at our MRI Center for more than
