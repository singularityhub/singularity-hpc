               containers and reproducibility to scientific computing. Using
               Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible
               environments of their choosing and design, and these complete
               environments can easily be copied and executed on other
               platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that
               harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and
               researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common
               workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case,
               Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC
               centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute
               software and compute environments. This ability to create and
               deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a
               previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing
               development for computational science.",

                 provide an alternative to complex and time-consuming
                 installation processes needed for scientiﬁc software. The ease
                 of deployment and the process isolation they enable, as well
                 as the reproducibility they permit across environments and
                 versions, are among the qualities that make them interesting
                 candidates for the construction of bioinformatic
                 infrastructures, at any scale from single workstations to high
                 throughput computing architectures. The Docker Hub is a public
                 registry which can be used to distribute bioinformatic
                 software as Docker images. However, its lack of curation and
                 its genericity make it difﬁcult for a bioinformatics user to
                 ﬁnd the most appropriate images needed. BioShaDock is a
                 bioinformatics-focused Docker registry, which provides a local
                 and fully controlled environment to build and publish
                 bioinformatic software as portable Docker images. It provides
                 a number of improvements over the base Docker registry on
                 authentication and permissions management, that enable its
                 integration in existing bioinformatic infrastructures such as
                 computing platforms. The metadata associated with the
                 registered images are domain-centric, including for instance
                 concepts deﬁned in the EDAM ontology, a shared and structured
                 vocabulary of commonly used terms in bioinformatics. The
                 registry also includes user deﬁned tags to facilitate its
                 discovery, as well as a link to the tool description in the
                 ELIXIR registry if it already exists. If it does not, the
                 BioShaDock registry will synchronize with the registry to
                 create a new description in the Elixir registry, based on the
                 BioShaDock entry metadata. This link will help users get more
                 information on the tool such as its EDAM operations, input and
                 output types. This allows integration with the ELIXIR Tools
                 and Data Services Registry, thus providing the appropriate

                   reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance
                   to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike.
                   Though computational reproducibility seems more straight
                   forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex
                   and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes
                   being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious
                   challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code
                   developed for one research project cannot be successfully
                   executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review
                   current approaches to these issues, including virtual
                   machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then
                   examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines
                   several areas from systems research - such as operating
                   system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular
                   re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy,

               current approaches for computational experiment conservation and
               reproducibility have focused so far on two of the main
               components of the experiment, namely, data and method. In this
               paper, we propose a new approach that addresses the third
               cornerstone of experimental reproducibility: the equipment. This
               work focuses on the equipment of a computational experiment,
               that is, the set of software and hardware components that are
               involved in the execution of a scientific workflow. In order to
               demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we describe a use
               case scenario on the Text Analytics domain and the application
               of our approach to it. From the original workflow, we document
               its execution environment, by means of a set of semantic models
