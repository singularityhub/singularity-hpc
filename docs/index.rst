Singularity Registry HPC (shpc) is based off of the `Singularity Registry Client <https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry-cli>`_, but instead of
being intended for general interaction with Singularity containers and a local database, it's optimized for managing containers
in an HPC environment. Currently, this includes:

 - `LMOD <https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

You can use shpc if you are:

1. a linux administrator wanting to manage containers as modules for your cluster
2. a cluster user that wants to maintain your own folder of custom modules
3. a cluster user that simply wants to pull Singularity images as GitHub packages.

The library contains a collection of module recipes that will install containers,
so you can easily use them or write your own. 
To see the code, head over to the `repository <https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc/>`_.
To browse modules avalable as containers, see `the library <https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-hpc/>`_.
